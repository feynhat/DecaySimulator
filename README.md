# DecaySimulator
Monte Carlo simulations of radioactive decay chains.

You must have a standard C compiler and `gnuplot` to run this program.

 * To run the program, open the directory `DecaySimulator` in terminal and type
`./run`.

 * Enter values for decay constants of A and B (Note that these constants have
unit *per iteration* and not *per unit time*).

 * Enter the number of iterations that you want to run. Leave it blank for
 default value `100000`.

 * Enter the initial number of nuclei of A. Leave it blank for default value
 `100000`.

 * Enter the name of the file in which you want the textual data of generated by
 the simulation. Leave it blank for default value `plot.dat` (It will be created
 if it does not exist and will be replaced if it does).

 * Enter the name of the file in which you want the plot to be drawn by gnuplot.
 Leave it blank for default value `MC_Plot.png` (It will be created if it does
 not exit and will be replaced if does).

##Examples

Following are some plots generated by the DecaySimulator (using gnuplot).

### k1 > k2

#### Comparison with analytical plot
The plot generated using Monte Carlo simulation is very similar to the one which
we get by analytically solving the differential equation for the 3-species decay
chain:

### k2 << k1
